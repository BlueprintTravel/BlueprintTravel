How to Build the application:

The application must be run on Android Studio with an emulator or device attached. The starting point of this application is from LoginActivity so the app should be run from there. From that screen, you will either need to register a new account or login using the sample email and password
      sample email: example@example.com
      sample password: 123456
You should then be redirected to the map. You can test that this is working with the correct location by updating the gps coordinates on the emulator. You can then walk through the rest of the application to display a route on the map.

Note: if there are any dependency issues, it may be necessary to sync the gradle.build file or add firebase to your project- it should be added but you may need to set that up independenty on your machine. If you run into any issues with this, email lmorrison4@wisc.edu and I can add you as a member on the firebase console.
